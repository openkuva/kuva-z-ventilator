<h1 name="Disass">Disassembling the machine for cleaning</h1>
<p>
Routine cleaning restores and disinfects both the exterior and interior of the machine.
Some disassembly is required to do this.
</p><p>
Doing these steps exposes the cleaner to viruses, bacteria, and other substances that may
be harmful, and so should be done wearing appropriate PPE.
</p><p>
There is also a risk that another person may not realize that these components are
contaminated, and that the parts may contaminate any surface they are placed on.
</p>

<h1 name="Clean">Cleaning the machine</h1>

	<ol>

	<li>immediately disinfect the surface the parts were lying on</li>
	<li>after the time is up, wash the soaked parts in sterile water to remove the disinfectant then allow to dry</li>
	<li>reassemble, inserting new filters</li>
	</ol>
